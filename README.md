# OKCupidBot
Introduction:

After NS(national service), I started to learn python3 in my own time. After learning the basics, I wanted to move on to a small project to try and apply what I have learnt. I decided to help a friend out who was single and busy with work and had no time to find/meet new people. I thought of creating a auto-swiping bot to help him find new people on a dating app without needing him to spend time swiping on his own.


Prerequisites:
1) Download Python, selenium(pip install selenium) and chromedriver(add it into a Path variable)(to test: Type chromedriver.exe into your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS), if it opens a local session, it is installed correctly.)

2) Create a account_details.py file separately with variables:

'username' = 'your email address'

'password' = 'your password'
