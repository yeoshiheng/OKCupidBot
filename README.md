# OKCupidBot
Introduction: After NS(national service), I started to learn python3 in my own time. After learning the basics, I wanted to move on to a small project to try and apply what I have learnt. I decided to help a friend out who was single and busy with work and had no time to find/meet new people. I thought of creating a auto-swiping bot to help him find new people on a dating app without needing him to spend time swiping on his own.
